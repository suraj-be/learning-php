- php is a weakly typed language.
- At the beginning, php stood for 'Personal Home Page', now it is stands for 'HyperText Preprocessor'
- Along with reserved keywords, php also have reserved variables, most of them are used when dealing with forms.
  - $_GET, $_POST, $_COOKIE, $_SERVER, $_FILES, $_ENV, $this.
- For string, it is strlen() and for arrays, it is count().
- asort() is better than sort(), as it keeps the keys intact for associative arrays.  

------------ If not found returns an empty string ------------
- array_key_exists( 2 arguments )
- in_array( 2 arguments )
